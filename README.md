Rover localization in ROS using IMU, wheel encoders, and GPS RTK. Data is fused with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for accurate pose estimation. Results are visualized in RViz for reliable navigation and real-time monitoring.
Rover Odometry and Sensor Fusion with ROS
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This package provides a complete implementation for rover localization and visualization using ROS. The rover is equipped with an IMU (BNO055) and wheel encoders, which provide raw orientation and odometry data. These measurements are fused using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to generate accurate pose estimation. The results are visualized in RViz for real-time monitoring.


ðŸš€ Features

IMU node for orientation data

Encoder node for wheel odometry

EKF node for sensor fusion

Real-time visualization in RViz

Modular ROS structure for easy integration
